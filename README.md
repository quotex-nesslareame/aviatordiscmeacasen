## What is Halal Investing?

Halal investing is a type of investing that complies with the principles
of Islamic law. These principles include:

-   Prohibition of interest
-   Prohibition of gambling
-   Prohibition of investing in businesses that are involved in
    activities that are considered to be unethical or harmful to society

## Is Quotex Halal?

The question of whether or not Quotex is halal is a complex one. There
is no clear consensus among Islamic scholars on this issue.

Some scholars argue that Quotex is halal because it does not involve
interest or gambling. They argue that binary options trading is a form
of speculation, which is permissible under Islamic law.

Other scholars argue that Quotex is haram because it involves excessive
risk. They argue that binary options trading is a form of gambling,
which is forbidden under Islamic law.

## What is the Ruling of the Islamic Fiqh Academy on Binary Options Trading?

The Islamic Fiqh Academy (IFA) is an international body of Islamic
scholars that provides guidance on matters of Islamic law. In 2013, the
IFA issued a ruling on binary options trading. The ruling states that
binary options trading is haram, or forbidden under Islamic law.

The IFA\'s ruling is based on the following arguments:

-   Binary options trading involves interest, which is forbidden under
    Islamic law.
-   Binary options trading is a form of gambling, which is forbidden
    under Islamic law.
-   Binary options trading involves excessive risk, which is not
    permissible under Islamic law.

## Is it Safe to Trade on Quotex?

The IFA\'s ruling on binary options trading is binding on all Muslims.
Therefore, it is not permissible for Muslims to trade on Quotex.

There are a number of other binary options trading platforms that are
available to Indian traders. However, it is important to research these
platforms carefully before trading on them. Some of these platforms may
not be compliant with Islamic law.
